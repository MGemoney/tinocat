## Why I Always Push Wet Food

Here's the thing. Cats descended from desert animals. They have an almost stubbornly low thirst drive, which means they're walking around mildly dehydrated more often than most owners realize. Wet food — with its 75-80% moisture content — is one of the single best things you can do for your cat's kidneys, urinary tract, and overall health. Dry kibble alone just doesn't cut it.

Beyond hydration, premium wet food delivers what cats actually need — high animal protein, low carbohydrates, and a macronutrient profile that looks a lot more like what they'd eat in the wild. Not all cat food is created equal. Not even close.

## What I Actually Look for on a Label

Let me be direct. The first ingredient needs to be a named protein — not "meat meal," not "animal by-products," but actual chicken, turkey, or salmon. If you can't tell what animal it came from, that's a red flag.

I look for AAFCO-compliant formulas that are complete and balanced. This guarantees the essentials are covered — taurine (which cats literally cannot produce on their own), vitamins, minerals, the whole package. Skip anything loaded with artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. Quality brands don't need that stuff.

And here's something people overlook: texture matters. Pate, shredded, chunks in gravy — your cat will have opinions about this. Strong opinions. (And they will have opinions.) You may need to buy a few different styles before you find the one that gets the bowl licked clean. Trust me on this one.

## Brands That Have Earned My Recommendation

Ziwi Peak consistently impresses me with its sky-high meat inclusion and short ingredient lists — you can actually read and understand every item on the label. Tiki Cat offers whole-protein recipes that most cats find genuinely irresistible. Weruva is a strong pick for cats who prefer flaked or shredded textures in a light broth.

If your cat has sensitivities to common proteins, Feline Natural is worth exploring — they offer lamb and venison options that can sidestep chicken or fish allergies. Applaws takes a simpler approach with complementary recipes that work beautifully as meal toppers alongside a balanced base. (Yes, I've tried all of these. My cats have strong feelings.)

## My Honest Take on the Price Question

Premium wet food is expensive — there's no getting around that — but the quality difference is real. The ingredient density, the protein content, the health benefits for cats prone to urinary issues or chronic dehydration — it adds up to something meaningful over the long run.

That said, every cat is an individual. What one cat devours, another will sniff and walk away from. I say that with love. Before committing to a brand or formula, talk to your vet. Your vet knows your cat's specific needs better than any review site — including this one. They can help you find the right balance of nutrition, budget, and your cat's own preferences.
