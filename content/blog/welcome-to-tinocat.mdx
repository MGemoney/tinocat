I got my first cat eleven years ago. I thought I was prepared. I had read a handful of articles, bought a bag of whatever food was on sale, and figured the rest would sort itself out. It did not sort itself out. (I say that with love.) That messy, wonderful, completely improvised start is the reason TinoCat exists today.

Welcome to TinoCat.

We built this because we couldn't find what we were looking for — a single place that was genuinely helpful, rigorously researched, and written by people who actually live with cats. Not a content mill churning out recycled advice. Not a brand disguised as a blog. Just honest, useful information from people who have cleaned up the 4am hairball and lived to tell about it.

## What You'll Find Here

Here's the thing — cat ownership touches a surprising number of topics, and we wanted to cover all of them:

- **Breed Guides** — In-depth profiles on dozens of breeds, from the chaotic energy of an Abyssinian to the plush, floppy calm of a Ragdoll. We cover temperament, care needs, and the stuff breeders don't always mention upfront.
- **Health and Wellness** — Honest articles on common health concerns, preventative care, vaccinations, and knowing when a vet visit can't wait. Your cat can't tell you something's wrong, so we help you learn to read the signs.
- **Food and Nutrition Reviews** — Real reviews of cat food, treats, and supplements. We buy it, we read the labels, and we tell you what we actually think. No sponsorship strings attached.
- **Behavior and Training** — Why does your cat knock things off the counter? Why the midnight zoomies? Why the slow blink from across the room that somehow makes your whole day better? We dig into all of it — plus practical tips for litter training, scratching, and the stuff that actually matters day-to-day.
- **Tools and Calculators** — Interactive tools like our cat age calculator and feeding guide, because sometimes you just need a quick answer without reading a 2,000-word article. (We get it.)

## What Makes Us Different

Let me be direct. There is a lot of pet content on the internet, and most of it is mediocre. We hold ourselves to a higher standard — every article is carefully researched, checked for accuracy, and written like we're talking to a friend, not lecturing a stranger. We don't do jargon for jargon's sake. We don't let advertisers shape our recommendations. If a product isn't great, we'll say so.

## Come Along

TinoCat is just getting started and we have a lot planned — new guides, new tools, and a growing community of people who care deeply about their cats. Browse around. Bookmark something. Come back next week.

Your cats are lucky to have someone who cares enough to look things up in the first place. Trust me on this one — that matters more than you think.

Welcome to TinoCat. We're glad you're here.
