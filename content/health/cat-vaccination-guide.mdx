Let me be direct: skipping vaccines is a risk. I understand the hesitation — nobody loves hauling their cat to the vet, and your cat certainly has opinions about the experience. But vaccines remain one of the simplest, most effective things you can do to keep them alive and healthy. That's just the reality.

## Core Vaccines — Every Cat, No Exceptions

There are two vaccines every cat needs regardless of whether they ever set a paw outside.

**FVRCP** is the big combo shot — it covers rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, and panleukopenia. The first two cause nasty upper respiratory infections. Panleukopenia — sometimes called feline distemper — attacks the immune system and is frequently fatal in kittens. One vaccine, three serious diseases covered. Hard to argue with that math.

**Rabies** is required by law in most places, and for good reason. Rabies is always fatal once symptoms appear. Always. Even if your cat lives strictly indoors, a bat slipping through a window or an accidental escape is all it takes. I say that with love, not to scare you — but this one is non-negotiable.

## Non-Core Vaccines — Based on Your Cat's Life

These depend on lifestyle, and your vet will help you figure out what makes sense.

**Feline Leukemia (FeLV)** is strongly recommended for all kittens and any adult cat that goes outdoors. FeLV suppresses the immune system and can lead to cancer — it's serious. If your cat is indoor-only and has been tested, your vet may decide the risk is low enough to skip boosters after the kitten series.

**FIV, Bordetella, and Chlamydia** vaccines come up in specific situations — outdoor cats who get into fights, cats in shelters or boarding, multi-cat households with respiratory issues circulating. Not every cat needs these, and that's fine.

## The Kitten Schedule

Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier — the timing actually matters. Kittens get some immunity from their mother's milk, but it fades fast. The standard schedule looks roughly like this:

- **6 to 8 weeks:** First FVRCP, first FeLV
- **10 to 12 weeks:** Second FVRCP, second FeLV
- **14 to 16 weeks:** Third FVRCP, first rabies
- **1 year:** Boosters for FVRCP, rabies, and FeLV if applicable

That gap between maternal immunity wearing off and vaccines kicking in is real, which is why sticking to the schedule — not pushing it back a few weeks because life gets busy — genuinely matters.

## Adult Boosters

After the kitten series and the one-year boosters, most adult cats need FVRCP every three years and rabies every one to three years depending on local laws and which vaccine your vet uses. It's not a huge time commitment. One vet visit can cover it alongside their annual wellness exam.

## After the Shot

Most cats handle vaccines without any drama. You might notice a little sluggishness or a decreased appetite for a day — totally normal. A small bump at the injection site can appear and usually resolves on its own. Serious reactions like facial swelling or difficulty breathing are rare, but if you see them, call your vet immediately. (And no, your cat's attitude toward you for the rest of the day does not count as a medical side effect.)

Obviously, I'm not your vet — always talk to yours about the right vaccine plan for your specific cat and situation. But keeping up with vaccines? That's one of the easiest wins in cat care. Trust me on this one.
