Here's the thing about cats — they are masters of disguise when it comes to pain. By the time you notice something is off, the problem has often been brewing for a while. So let me walk you through the big ones, because knowing what to watch for is half the battle.

## Urinary Tract Issues (FLUTD)

This one's important. If your cat is suddenly spending way more time in the litter box, or crying while they're in there, or — and this is the real red flag — trying to pee and nothing is coming out, you need to act fast. Male cats especially can develop full blockages, and I'll be direct: that's a life-threatening emergency. Not an exaggeration. Get to a vet immediately.

## Dental Disease

Most cats have some form of dental disease by age three. I know, not exactly a fun topic. But imagine eating every meal with a raging toothache and no way to tell anyone about it. That's just the reality for a lot of cats whose teeth go unchecked. Red gums, bad breath that's worse than the usual cat-food smell, drooling — these are your clues.

## Obesity

Studies suggest over half of pet cats are overweight, and honestly that tracks with what I've seen. Extra weight isn't just cosmetic — it opens the door to diabetes, joint pain, and heart problems. If you can't feel your cat's ribs without pressing hard, it's time to talk portions with your vet.

## Upper Respiratory Infections

Sneezing fits, goopy eyes, a nose that sounds stuffy — think of it like a cat cold, except it's highly contagious between cats. Shelters and multi-cat homes are hotspots. Most cases are viral, so antibiotics won't help unless a secondary bacterial infection shows up.

## Parasites

Even indoor cats can pick up fleas, ear mites, or intestinal worms. A single flea hitching a ride on your shoe is all it takes. Year-round prevention is the simplest move you can make here. Trust me on this one.

## Vomiting and Diarrhea

The occasional hairball? Normal. But if your cat is throwing up multiple times a week or has persistent diarrhea, something deeper is going on — food sensitivities, infections, or worse. Don't wait it out hoping it resolves on its own.

## Kidney Disease

One of the most common diagnoses in older cats. The early signs are subtle: drinking more water, peeing more, slowly losing weight. Routine bloodwork — especially once your cat hits about seven — can catch kidney changes well before they become a crisis.

## Hyperthyroidism and Diabetes

Both show up frequently in senior cats and share some overlapping symptoms — weight changes, increased thirst, shifts in appetite. The good news is that both are very manageable with the right treatment plan. The key is catching them early through regular vet visits.

## Skin Allergies

If your cat is scratching themselves raw, losing patches of fur, or covered in tiny scabs along their back and neck, allergies are a strong possibility. Food, fleas, and environmental triggers are the usual suspects. Figuring out which one takes patience, but your vet can help you narrow it down.

## When to Call Your Vet

Any sudden change — hiding, not eating, lethargy, behavioral shifts — deserves attention. Annual wellness exams are non-negotiable, and twice a year once your cat is a senior. Obviously, I'm not your vet — always talk to yours for advice specific to your cat. But being observant and acting early? That's the best thing you can do.
