I'll be honest — this article might change the way you feed your cat. It changed how I feed mine.

Most of what we've been taught about cat nutrition comes from marketing, not science. And when you dig into the actual research, it gets uncomfortable fast. The good news is that the fix is surprisingly simple. The bad news is that a lot of us — myself included, at one point — have been doing it wrong.

A lot of the information here draws on the work of **Dr. Lisa A. Pierson, DVM**, a veterinarian who has spent years researching feline nutrition. Her site, [catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/), is one of the most thorough resources on the topic, and I'd encourage anyone serious about their cat's health to read it in full.

## Cats Are Obligate Carnivores — and That Changes Everything

Here's the thing most people miss: cats are not small dogs. They're **obligate carnivores**, meaning their bodies are designed to get nutrition almost exclusively from animal tissue. They lack salivary amylase — the enzyme that starts carbohydrate digestion in the mouth. They can't manufacture certain essential amino acids from plant sources. Their natural prey is roughly 70–75% water and only about 1–2% carbohydrates ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)).

This isn't a preference. It's biology.

## The Problem with Dry Food

Let me be direct: dry cat food is convenient for us, not optimal for them. According to Dr. Pierson, there are three fundamental issues ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)):

**1. Water content is dangerously low.** Dry food contains just 5–10% water, compared to ~78% in canned food and ~70–75% in natural prey. Cats evolved getting moisture from their food — they have a naturally low thirst drive. Dr. Pierson's research shows that cats on dry food consume approximately **half the total water** of cats eating canned food, even accounting for bowl drinking. That chronic, low-grade dehydration? It has consequences.

**2. Carbohydrate content is absurdly high.** Dry food typically derives 35–50% of its calories from carbohydrates. A cat's natural diet? About 1–2%. That's 500 to 1,000% more carbs than their bodies were designed to handle ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)). The excess gets stored as fat, contributes to insulin resistance, and sets the stage for diabetes and obesity.

**3. Plant-based protein replaces animal-based protein.** Many dry foods rely on corn gluten meal, soy, and peas for protein. These don't provide the complete amino acid profile an obligate carnivore needs. It looks good on the label, but it's fundamentally species-inappropriate.

And the old claim that kibble cleans teeth? Dr. Pierson calls it "grossly overrated, inaccurate, and unsupported by studies." Most kibble shatters on contact — and many cats swallow it whole ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)).

## The Case for Wet Food

This is going to sound too simple, but here it is: **feeding canned wet food instead of dry food addresses the majority of diet-related health risks in cats.** The water content alone is a game-changer.

Dr. Pierson puts it plainly: "I would much rather see a cat eat any canned food versus any dry food" — and yes, that includes budget brands like Friskies and 9-Lives over premium dry food ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)). That's not a typo.

## What to Look for on Labels

Not all canned food is created equal. Here's what actually matters:

- **Named animal protein as the first ingredient** — chicken, turkey, or rabbit, not "meat meal" or "animal by-products"
- **Low carbohydrates** — under 10% of calories is ideal. (Good luck finding this on the label, though — pet food companies aren't required to list carbohydrate content. You often need to contact the manufacturer directly.)
- **Pate over gravy** — gravies and sauces tend to use high-carb thickeners
- **78% moisture or less** — some pouch foods exceed 87% moisture, which means you're paying a premium for water ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/))

For what it's worth, Dr. Pierson's go-to recommendations include Fancy Feast pates, certain Friskies Classic varieties, Weruva, and Tiki Cat — proof that good nutrition doesn't have to be expensive.

## The Disease Connection

This is where it gets serious. According to Dr. Pierson's research and the studies she cites:

- **Diabetes:** Obese cats are 4 times more likely to develop diabetes. In one study, switching to a low-carb canned diet allowed 68% of diabetic cats to stop needing insulin entirely. Another study by Dr. Claudia Reusch found remission rates jumped from 15–25% to 50–70% on low-carb, high-protein diets ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/feline-diabetes/)).

- **Urinary tract disease:** Water is the single most important factor in urinary health. Cats on canned food produce approximately double the urine volume, mechanically flushing the bladder. Dr. Pierson notes that urethral obstruction — a life-threatening emergency — is "highly unlikely" in cats on 100% canned food diets ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/cats-and-urinary-tract-diseases/)).

- **Obesity:** Cats lack satiety signals for carbohydrates the way they do for protein and fat. Free-feeding dry food — which packs roughly 400 calories per cup — is a recipe for weight gain ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/feline-obesity-an-epidemic-of-fat-cats/)).

- **Kidney disease:** Chronic dehydration from dry food may contribute to or exacerbate kidney disease over time ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)).

## Transitioning from Dry to Wet

I won't pretend this is easy. Dry food is coated with animal digest sprays that create a strong preference — Dr. Pierson uses the word "addiction," and honestly, it tracks. If your cat has eaten kibble their whole life, they may resist the switch.

Here's what works: patience. Start with 10% canned mixed into their regular food and gradually increase. Never fast a cat for more than 18 hours when introducing new food. Flavor enhancers like FortiFlora probiotic, a sprinkle of parmesan, or a drizzle of tuna water can help. Some cats switch in weeks. Others take months. That's okay ([catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/)).

## The Bottom Line

If you take one thing from this article, let it be this: **the single best thing you can do for your cat's long-term health is switch from dry food to canned food.** It doesn't have to be expensive. It doesn't have to be complicated. But the difference in hydration, carbohydrate intake, and protein quality is enormous.

I'm not your vet — always consult yours for advice specific to your cat, especially if they have existing health conditions. But I'd also encourage you to read [catinfo.org](https://catinfo.org/) yourself. Dr. Pierson has spent years compiling the evidence, and it's worth your time.

Trust me on this one.
