I won't pretend brushing your cat's teeth is easy. It's not. But here's the thing — somewhere between 50 and 90 percent of cats over age three have dental disease, and most of their owners have no idea. Cats are incredibly good at hiding mouth pain. They'll eat through it, act normal through it, and slowly suffer through it. So yeah, dental care matters more than most people think.

## What Dental Problems Actually Look Like

Your cat's teeth — yes, all 30 of them — need regular attention. But since cats won't exactly open wide and say "ahh," you have to know the subtle signs. Watch for breath that's noticeably worse than the standard cat-food smell. Red or puffy gums, especially along the gum line. Drooling, or that thing where they paw at their mouth like something's bothering them. Dropping food while eating, or suddenly chewing only on one side. If your cat's appetite has tanked for no obvious reason, their teeth could be the culprit.

Here's what I wish someone had told me earlier: dental disease often hides below the gum line. A cat's teeth can look fine on the surface while the roots are being slowly destroyed underneath. That's why annual oral exams from your vet — not just your own eyeball assessment — are essential.

## Brushing at Home (Yes, Really)

I'll be honest. Your cat will absolutely act like you're torturing them. You are not. With patience, most cats can learn to tolerate brushing — and even 30 seconds of brushing makes a real difference.

Start by letting them lick some cat-specific enzymatic toothpaste off your finger for a few days. (Never use human toothpaste — it's toxic to cats.) Then introduce a soft cat toothbrush or a finger brush. Lift the lip, brush the outer surfaces in small circles, keep it quick, and reward them like they just saved the world afterward. Consistency beats perfection here. A few times a week is genuinely helpful, even if each session is brief.

## When Brushing Isn't Happening

Look, I get it — some cats simply will not allow it, and you value your fingers. Dental treats, prescription dental diets, and water additives can all help. The key is looking for the VOHC (Veterinary Oral Health Council) seal, which means the product actually meets standards for reducing plaque or tartar. These are supplements to brushing, not true replacements, but they're far better than doing nothing.

## Professional Cleanings

No amount of at-home effort replaces a professional dental cleaning. Your cat goes under anesthesia — I know that sounds scary, but modern protocols make it very safe — and the vet scales tartar above and below the gum line, polishes the teeth, and takes dental X-rays to see what's really going on underneath. Sometimes teeth need to come out, and honestly, cats do remarkably well after extractions. A pain-free mouth with fewer teeth beats a full mouth that hurts. (Your vet will thank you for not waiting until things get severe.)

Start a dental routine as early as you can. But if your cat is already an adult and you've never touched their teeth? It's never too late to begin. Obviously, I'm not your vet — always talk to yours for guidance specific to your cat's mouth. But trust me on this one: dental care is one of the most underrated things you can do for your cat's quality of life.
