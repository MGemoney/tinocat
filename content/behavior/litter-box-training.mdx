I'll be honest — the litter box isn't the glamorous part of cat ownership. But get it right, and you'll barely think about it. Get it wrong, and you'll think about it constantly. In the worst way.

Here's the good news: most cats take to litter training almost instinctively. Your job is mostly just not messing up what nature already wired into them.

## The Box Itself

Size matters more than aesthetics here. The box should be at least one and a half times the length of your cat. If your cat looks cramped in there, they probably are — and they'll let you know by finding somewhere else to go. For kittens, pick a box with low sides so those little legs can actually get in.

Covered or uncovered? Here's the thing — most cats prefer uncovered. Covered boxes trap odor inside, and what smells "contained" to you smells like a phone booth of misery to your cat's sensitive nose. (Yes, you need one litter box per cat plus one extra. I don't make the rules.)

## Where You Put It Matters — a Lot

Picture this: you place the litter box right next to the washing machine. The spin cycle kicks on mid-business. Your cat bolts. And now they associate that spot with terror. That's not a training problem — that's a you problem.

Put the box somewhere quiet, low-traffic, and always accessible. Not behind a closed door. Not next to their food — cats are hardwired to avoid eliminating near where they eat. Think about it from their perspective: they need to feel safe and unhurried in there.

## Choosing a Litter

Cats have opinions about litter the way some people have opinions about coffee. Strong, specific, and non-negotiable.

Unscented clumping clay is the safest bet for most cats. Those heavily perfumed litters? They're marketed to you, not your cat. To your cat, lavender-scented litter is an assault on the senses. If you want to try a natural alternative — walnut, corn, paper — go for it, but transition slowly. Mix the new stuff with the old over a week. Sudden switches lead to litter box strikes. Trust me on this one.

## Training Steps (the Easy Part)

For kittens: after meals, after naps, after play — set them in the box. Scratch the litter gently with your finger to show them the idea. When they use it, a calm "good job" is all you need. No big celebrations at the box. You want the whole experience to feel normal, not eventful.

For adult cats new to your home, keep them in one room with the box for the first few days. Let them map that location before giving them run of the house. This takes patience. I mean real patience.

## When Things Go Wrong

If your cat suddenly stops using the box, call the vet first. Not eventually — first. Urinary issues are common and painful, and your cat isn't being spiteful. (They're not being dramatic. Okay, sometimes they are. But not about this.)

If the vet clears them, look at your setup. Is the box clean? Scoop daily, full change every week or two. Has anything changed in the house — new pet, new furniture, a move? Cats are creatures of routine, and disruption hits them harder than we expect. Whatever you do, never punish a cat for a litter box miss. It doesn't teach them anything except to be afraid of you. And that makes everything worse.

The boring truth is that consistency and cleanliness solve ninety percent of litter box problems. This is the boring part. It's also the most important part.
